# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: July 20, 2021
######
**Today's Progress**: Did 3 Array Questions (Medium-level) and 2 questions of HashMap (Easy-level) from Must-Do-GFG list.
<br> Did **Bonus** Stock Buy Sell Question from Dynamic Programming.

**Thoughts:** I have struggled doing 5 questions in a day, thankfully, managed to do so today. Though I missed Web-Dev!
